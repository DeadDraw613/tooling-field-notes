## Tool Field Notes: 

### Overview

This repository contains **personal field notes and proof-of-concepts** documenting how I experimented with various tools. The goal is not to teach these tools from scratch, but to capture **usage patterns, edge cases, and observations** discovered while testing web applications and APIs in lab and test environments with these tools.

---

### Scope and Intent

* Practical, experience-driven usage
* No installation guides or usage tutorials
* Commands and scripts are intentionally concise and contextual

This repository is best read as a **working notebook**, not a reference manual.

### Environment

All experiments were conducted in:

* Personal lab environments
* Test applications
* Intentionally vulnerable or non-production systems

No testing was performed against unauthorized targets.

### Usage Disclaimer

These notes are provided as-is and reflect my own workflow and preferences. They are not intended to represent best practices for every scenario. If something here sparks an idea, adapt it to your own environment and constraints.

## Why This Repo Exists

* Evidence of hands-on experimentation
* A reference for patterns I return to
* A lightweight way to document learning without over-formalizing it
